![alt tag](./screenshot.png)

This project was intended to provide a replacement business system for the proess of capturing impact statements from portfolio 
companies for the investment firm Renewal Funds.

The business process called for the creation of a number of portfolio companies for a particular financial year and for those portfolio companies
to login to the application and provide impact statements, which consist of a collecton of stories, answered questionnaires and images.

The application consists of a Wordpress back-end, used by Renewal Funds employees, and a web front-end, used by the portfolio companies.

The designs and business processes were proved by the UX/UI team at Red Academy.

##Technologies Used

- WordPress
- PHP
- HTML5
- CSS3/SASS
- JQuery

##Personal Learnings

This project allowed me to explore the use of WordPress to create a content management system 
website with a user accessible back end UI.  Required functionality necessitated investigation
 and use of the WordPress template hierarchy for appropriate archive and other page types.

Use was made of plugins for third party functionality as well as development of custom widgets
and post types for various data components.

This project made heavy use of CSS and SASS for presentational styling. The design specification required particular attention to be made to flexbox for positioning.

GULP was used to add developer functionality for task automation in the creation of minified JS and CSS files.
