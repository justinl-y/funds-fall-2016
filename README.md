![alt tag](./themes/renewal-funds/screenshot.png)

This project was intended to provide a replacement business system for the process of capturing impact statements from portfolio 
companies for the investment firm Renewal Funds.

The business process called for the creation of a number of portfolio companies for a particular financial year and for those portfolio companies
to login to the application and provide impact statements.  These impact statements consist of a collection of stories, answered questionnaires and images.

The application consists of a Wordpress back-end, used by Renewal Funds employees, and a web front-end, used by the portfolio companies, with 
designs and business processes proved by UX/UI at Red Academy.

JLY - The development of this project allowed me to explore some of the functionality aspects of WordPress, especially in regards to query design and the PHP programming.
This project also enabled me to investigate the intricacies of programming plugins and manipulating their functionality to the project requirements.  Additionally I gained 
very useful experience in project and team management as this project continued.
